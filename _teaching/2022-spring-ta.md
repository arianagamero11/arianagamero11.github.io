I assisted Professor Joyce Robins with the Calculus-Based Introduction to Statistics core class. The main topics we covered were:  graphical and numerical summaries of data; the normal distribution, probability, random variables, and sampling distributions; estimation and hypothesis testing for means and proportions; comparing two populations; two-way contingency tables; introduction to linear regression. I mainly assisted prof. Robins in crafting problem sets and exercises using R.
