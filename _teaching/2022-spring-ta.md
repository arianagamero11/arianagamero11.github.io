I assisted Professor Joyce Robins with the Calculus-Based Introduction to Statistics core class. The main topics we covered were: Solow Growth, IS-LM, Real Business Cycles, and Keynesian/Classical money demand. I mainly assisted prof. Robins in crafting problem sets and exercises using R. [Syllabus.]() [Some exercises from problem sets I wrote.]()
