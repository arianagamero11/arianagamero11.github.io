I assisted Professor Xavier Sala-I-Martin with the Intermediate Macroeconomics core class for the second year in a row. The main models we covered were: Solow Growth, IS-LM, Real Business Cycles, and Keynesian/Classical money demand. I held weekly office hours and recitations, graded assignments and provided ideas for exercises in problem sets.
