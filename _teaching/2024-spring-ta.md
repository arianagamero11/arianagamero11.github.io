I assisted Professor Irasema Alonso with the Intermediate Macroeconomics core class with weekly recitations and office hours. The main topics we covered were: national income, economic growth (Solow growth model), inflation and unemployment, business cycles, fiscal and monetary policy, the financial system, financial crises, and international macroeconomics. The course used Mankiw's book for theory. [Syllabus](syllabus2024.pdf)
