I am a Research Analyst in [Morgan Stanley's Global Macro Research team] (https://www.morganstanley.com/what-we-do/research). I completed my undergraduate studies in Economics and Statistics at Columbia University and was a research and teaching assistant for the Columbia Economics Department for three years. I am an alum of the Federal Reserve Board, Innovations for Poverty Action (IPA) Peru, and Carroll Round. My research experience has examined interest rate caps and credit access, trends in credit scoring, loan-level financial covenants, the accuracy of financial institutions' CPI estimates, and foreign direct investment in Argentina. More recently, I’ve been working on projects on Time Series Econometrics and inflation persistence in the United States, and studying the role of the Phillips curve inversion as a determinant of the US stock–bond correlation.
